Memo Tobias: The problem of the book is, that roadmap.dashboard has to be loaded for each chapter, otherwise functions are not defined
Also: In _variables, the parameter definition is different than in the roadmap.document repository and would have to adapted in each chapter
Advantage: chapters can be rendered indiviually. I don't always have to go back to the main file an define the chapters. This will save time
My conclusion at the moment is that I stick to the current roadmap.document repository and use the book option for upcoming projects
