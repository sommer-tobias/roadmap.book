# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a Quarto book.

Memo Tobias: The problem of the book is, that roadmap.dashboard has to be loaded for each chapter, otherwise functions are not defined
Also: In _variables, the parameter definition is different than in the roadmap.document repository and would have to adapted in each chapter
Advantage: chapters can be rendered indiviually. I don't always have to go back to the main file an define the chapters. This will save time
